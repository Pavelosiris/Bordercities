Visual Overhaul for Cities:Skylines

Welcome to the Bordercities repo!  First and foremost, an introductory note to fellow C:S modders:  Barring the exceptions mentioned within LICENSE, you are free to do absolutely anything you want with my code. I can't be everywhere and do everything at once, thus, if something I write can simplify the process for you, I've effectively helped to better the C:S modding community and I feel awesome about that. Also, I love helping without having to do anything XD
